 <p>A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers because they can only be divided evenly by 1 and themselves. Numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers, while 1 is neither prime nor composite, having only one divisor. </p>
